# Description

The Urban Woodland Pursuit is integrating datasets from social and ecological scientists to better understand the dynamics that influence composition and conditions of forest communities. It also aims to identify most affective management approaches. The Pursuit is working in Chicago, New York, Baltimore/Washington DC, and Philadelphia metro areas. 

## Summer institute goals

During the summer workshop we will collect the following datasets:

- Applicable census data
- NLCD
- UTC
- Forest change database
- Roads

On a broad scale, these datasets will be used to understand how forest patch size/density correlate with socio-economic variables across the metropolitan regions of the four cities of interest.

Additionally, we will format forest composition data into the NPS vegetation platform so that we can begin to develop a framework for further data integration.


## Work responsibilities

Mysha, Megan and Lindsay: 1. Define areas of interest and create shapefile. 2. Aqcuire and format forest change database, NLCD, UTC and census for areas of interest. 3. Create regression models to quantify changes in forest size and distribution

Amanda and Vince: Acquire forest composition datasets and integrate them into NPS program.
